            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__paragrafo__about">I'm a video editor with over 15 years of experience in advertising, where 7 of them were dedicated to the online educational area. I'm bilingual (English and Portuguese) and nowadays I'm looking for to profisionalize myself on Spanish as well, I've did a Korean course and I know a little bit of french too. In addition to previous knowledge, today I'm studying UX/UI and front-end content (emphasis in HTML, CSS and Javascript) to fullfil my backpack within my carreer. Besides, I have more than 5 years of experience in agile methodologies (like SCRUM) and headed tons of projects related to organisation and business promotion. I'm a very dedicated worker, commited and organised, and I'm sure I'll be a great addition to yout team.           
            </p>
            
            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__paragrafo__about">Besides the traditional work, I have worked as a social media and writer (reviews) on my old project Fast Food Cultural, a news website for the pop world with social responsibility; I worked as a content producer for my own YouTube channel about games, humor and cooking; I produced a podcast that dealt with general subjects; I had a game livestream project for almost 4 years; and I have also worked as a volunteer in Dublin for the Cancer Institute thrift store. In addition, I really like culinary matters, bicycles, cultures, games and I venture into 3D modeling and programming as well.
